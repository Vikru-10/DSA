        Brute Force - Time O(n2), Space O(1) #TLE
        Trick(Nothing to be clever done here)

        for i in range(len(numbers)-1):
            for j in range(i+1,len(numbers)):
                sum = numbers[i] + numbers[j];
                if(sum==target):
                    return [i+1,j+1];
        
        Best Solution - Time O(n), Space O(1) #Accepted
        Trick(Two pointers because array is sorted and we can predetermined the positions of i and j also search space can be predetermined with sum, on incrementing i would increase the sum and on decreasing j sum would recuce i.e bcz array is sorted)
        
        i, j = 0, len(numbers)-1;
        while(i<j):
            sum = numbers[i] + numbers[j];
            if(sum==target):
                return [i+1,j+1];
            if(sum<target):
                i += 1;
            else:
                j -= 1;
